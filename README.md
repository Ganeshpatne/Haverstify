# Harvestify

Harvestify is a Machine Learning and Deep Learning based web application that helps in agricultural decision support. It provides:

- Crop recommendation based on soil and weather data  
- Fertilizer recommendation based on soil nutrients and crop type  
- Plant disease detection from leaf images  

This project demonstrates how ML and DL can be applied in precision farming.
